// Create a function that generates and returns a random whole number between 0 and 10. 
// Write a web page to test it by having a button that, when clicked runs a function that: - Uses that function to generate a random number. - Displays that number on the screen. Your final application should have two functions - one to make the random number, and one to handle the click.
