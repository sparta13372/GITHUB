    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <h3>
      I feel like that even though this is a simple drawing, it took a lot of
      thinking. The biggest problem I had with this was my efficiency, and this
      is something I have every intention on working on. <br />
      The biggest thing I learned was how to create, position, and design shapes
      using JavaScript. The resource that helped the most was the p5.js book,
      really making it clear on how to do certain tasks. <br />
      Overall, a fun and educational first assignment.
